1. There will be a specific function, say:
   
   void *DataTXRX(void *ptr);

   which handles the transmition and reception. This function can be a
   single shot, which is used to transmit the device options, or 
   infinitely looped during the measurement mode.
   
   A structure will be passed by pointer to this function in order to
   control its behavior:

   struct Options{
	   bool oneshot;
	   bool packet_validation;
	   unsigned char buffer[BUF_MAX];
	   pthread_mutex_t mutex;
   };

   Packet verification will be done in this function and indicated by
   the packet_validation filed, but it won't resolve the buffer into 
   true measured value.

   This function sends the data in Options.buffer, and puts the receiving
   data in the same buffer.
