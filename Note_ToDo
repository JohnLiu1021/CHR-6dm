1. If the data reading thread is blocking at the read() call, could this thread
   be canceled by other thread? If so, other thread can be used as timer to
   count how much time did the thread spend on block reading.
   If not, the corresponding timeout settings must be done on the serial driver
   (VTIME, VMIN).

1.Answer:
   Yes, pthread_cancel can stop a blocking thread. However, in order to prevent
   some infinite blocking problem, a cleanup function should be registered.
   For instance, if the thread blocked after aquired the mutex, and the other
   thread wants to cancel it, then the mutex holding thread will be canceled 
   without releasing the mutex, thus that mutex will never be unlock again.
   Two functions can be used to register and unregister a clean up function:
   
   void pthread_cleanup_push(void (*routine)(void*),
		   	     void *arg);
   void pthread_cleanup_pop(int execute);
